Any morning it's going slow
Cup of coffee and I'm good to go
Taxi cab with the rest of the pain
On my way to oppress the men
I can't swallow, I can't speak
I feel sick and I look like shit
Heart pumping like a big bass drum
Hold on, baby, here it comes

It's a...
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Cold sweat runnin' down my back

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Can't breathe, everything gone black

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Overnight from JFK, see the light, I'm on my way
At the back in the middle row, 30,000 ft. below
I got the terror, I got the fear
All [?] for my time in need
Heart bumpin' like a loaded gun, hold on, baby here I come...

It's a...
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Cold sweat runnin' down my back

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
I can't breathe, everything gone black

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

The leaves have fallen (ooh)
The tears have gone (ahh)
The bees are swarming (ooh)
The wounding blow (ahh)
There's no use running (ooh)
Nowhere to hide (ahh)
You just can't keep it down (ooh)
The beast inside!

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Cold sweat runnin' down my back

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
I can't breathe, everything gone black

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Panic attack!
Panic attack!

Panic attack!
Panic attack!

Panic attack!
Panic attack!

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back
