Any morning it's going slow
Cup of coffee and I'm good to go
Taxi cab with the rest of the pain
On my way to oppress the men
I can't swallow, I can't speak
I feel sick and I look like shit
Heart pumping like a big bass drum
Hold on, baby, here it comes

It's a...
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Cold sweat runnin' down my back

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back

Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Can't breathe, everything gone black

(It's a...)
Panic attack!
Panic attack!
Straight ahead, never coming back
